Demo programs of real-time systems

## Lab1
Simulation of the trafic lights on the classic intersection.
## Lab2
More advanced control of the traffic lights from the previous example.
## Lab3
Simulation of the two elevators in an building. 
## Lab4
Previous example with added features such as automatic forwarding of the idle elevator to the floors with most frequent calls.
## Lab5
Multiprocessing consumer-producer example.
## Lab6
Simulation of the process scheduler (rate monotonic priority assignment-RMPA, 
                                      earliest deadline first-EDF, 
                                      least laxity first-LLF,
                                      SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR)
